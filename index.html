I live in a house that is a storey building. But in the future, I would like to live in a nature-friendly house in my hometown. That house will be located in my hometown in Nha Trang city. It will have 4 rooms in it. But there would be lots of trees, gardens, ponds and open spaces. I would rather live close to nature than live in a cramped urban building. There is no better feeling than enjoying the peaceful scenery of nature. I can enjoy the fresh air, and living there would be the perfect stress reliever. My house will be built with wood and some modern materials. Last but not least, it would be wonderful if my house had a spacious living room with a fireplace as well as an open-plan modern kitchen and a cozy dining room where I can invite all my friends over for dinner sometimes. The reason I want to have this splendid house is because I really like the harmony with nature, the peace of nature. And I think that house would really deliver that for me.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Describe a house/apartment that someone you know lives in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You should say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; whose house/apartment this is</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; where the house/apartment is</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what it looks like inside</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and explain what you like or dislike about this person&rsquo;s house/apartment</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today, I would like to tell you about my friend&#39;s house. His name is Huy. He lives in a small house in Nha Trang city. He lives with his family and his throne looks good, about 100 square meters. Besides, his bedroom is also beautifully decorated. The bedroom has a small bed with a moderate table and chair, 2 chairs and a large bookshelf that can hold many books. There are some paintings on the wall. The small kitchen is fully equipped with modern cooking tools and utensils. His computer is located in his bedroom and there is a large TV placed in the living space. In addition, he also has a flower garden arranged at the back of the house, which is really beautiful.

I used to play lots of games in my childhood, hide-and-seek-game were one of my favorites. We played it in an open space near my house. I played this game with my neighbor&#39;s kids. I was then around 8-9 years old and the other kids were around the same age. &nbsp;Sometimes you count to twenty, sometimes ten, sometimes one hundred. Sometimes there is a home base that you can run to and tag, becoming &quot;safe,&quot; sometimes you just wait to be found. The general idea is that one person is &quot;it,&quot; that person closes his or her eyes and counts to a certain number without looking and then he or she tries to find the others. I have never seen any adult person playing this game. So, I do not play this game anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;Describe an activity that you like to do with your friends in your free time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You should say: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what the activity is</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; how often you do it with your friends </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; where you do it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and explain why you like it</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every weekend, my friends and I have a lot of free time in the evening, so we often organize fun activities together. The activity that we regularly organize is soccer. In the past we used to rent a football field near my high school to play football. I usually play with my 12 friends, the game is divided into 2 teams, each team will have 5 players and 1 substitute. Although this activity is quite tiring, it can help me connect with friends and promote teamwork. It also brings many benefits to my health. In addition, it also helps me relieve stress, making me forget the negative things of life. Playing with friends makes me very happy, so I enjoyed this activity very much.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Topic 3</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Describe a news story you read/saw.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3">What kind of news story it was.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3">What happened to the people in the story.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3">Why the event was important enough to be reported on the news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and explain how you felt about the news story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether I like it or not, I receive tons of text messages on my mobile phone, most of which are usually not important, and there are a lot of spam messages. But for today, I want to talk about a really important text message. I received the message 1 week ago when I was away from my hometown because I was studying in Ho Chi Minh city. That night, I just got home from school, and suddenly I saw a message from my family. I was really shocked when I received this message, which said that my grandmother passed away. At first I didn&#39;t believe it was true, so I called my family to confirm myself. But the result is not what I expected. I felt very sad, and I immediately booked a bus ticket to go home. This is my most important message because my grandmother has lived with me since I was born, and I also have a lot of memories with her.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Describe an impressive story you heard from other people. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You should say: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what this story was about </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; when you heard about it </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; who told you this story</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and explain why you were impressed by it</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The impressive news that I heard through a call was the birth news of my nephew. One day I got a story from my mom and she gave me this happy news. After getting the news I was so happy and thrilled that I forgot everything and came to my hometown that very night to see the newborn baby. Having a baby at home was a dream of ours. So we were counting the days for the baby to come to this world. At the last moment of my sister&rsquo;s pregnancy, she became very ill and some complexities appeared as the doctors reported. Naturally, we were very anxious for the mother and the baby who is yet to come. When I got the call from my mum that my sister has become the mother of a beautiful baby and both are fine, I was on one hand very animated and on the other hand, relieved from the tension that I was going through for the few days. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">TOPIC 4</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Describe an experience when you traveled by public transport </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You should say: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; where you went </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what means of transportation you took </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; who you were with </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and explain how you felt about the trip.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8">I want to talk about a trip I took on public transportation about two years ago. It was my first bus ride. That morning, I woke up at 5 a.m. I changed my clothes and let the car out when suddenly my car broke down. I was at a stand for what to do because I couldn&#39;t accept a motorbike from my house to Tan Phu area for school. That ride is quite costly. So I decided to go to the nearest bus stop to wait. In the past, I always thought that the bus was unsafe because of driving too fast, but that day I experienced it. After a while, when I paid, I was surprised because it was so cheap, it wasn&#39;t 10 thousand Vietnamese Dong. After that day, I completely changed my mind about public transport. Now I also use public transport often because I am a student, it saves me more money than before.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Describe a trip that didn&rsquo;t go as you had planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;You should say: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; where you were traveling to &middot; who was traveling with you </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what didn&rsquo;t happen according to plan </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what you did and explain how you felt about the trip</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3 years ago, I had a trip to Orchid Island in Nha Trang city with my friends. It was a refreshing experience when I first came to an island. We included 7 people so we booked a taxi to move to the harbor. On the way to the harbor it was quite smooth, almost nothing happened. When we arrived, we continued to buy tickets to get on a boat to the island. While waiting for the boat, the sky started to rain. We were quite worried because the rain would greatly affect our journey. But that unfortunately happened when we were already on the boat and halfway there. The wind started to get strong, causing the boat to shake violently. But then we still reached the island safely, in return we still couldn&#39;t start the island tour because it was raining heavily here. We had to temporarily shelter from the rain in a small house, and put out food to eat, until before returning, the rain stopped, we spent a little hour visiting some places on the island. I&#39;m really upset when this is my first outing to encounter such a situation, we can&#39;t visit the whole island, I feel very sad because of this. This was probably my worst trip, all my plans were almost ruined.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Topic 5.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Describe an ideal job you would want to have in the future. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You should say: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what it would be</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; where you would do the job </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what skills would be needed for the job </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">and explain why it would be the ideal job for you</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had an early exposure to computers from an early age so I wanted to become a programmer. I have been learning to code since I was 16 years old until now. I want to work in some big companies andand I really want to work in European countries. To do this job, it is necessary to equip problem solving skills, teamwork skills, and good thinking ability. I think this job is perfect for me because I have a passion for this job. In addition to this job, I have no passion for other jobs, as evidenced by the fact that I am always searching and learning knowledge about this industry. The proof is that I always get the highest marks in IT-related subjects since entering university until now.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Describe a person who is good at his/her job. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You should say: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; who this person is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; what his or her job is </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&middot; how he or she likes the job and explain why this person is good at the job</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would like to tell you about my lecturer, he is not only a lecturer in information technology but also a computer programmer who works as a freelancer. It means he can travel anywhere and work anywhen he wants as long as he has a laptop and internet connection. This job involves writing software for other companies who need the software to solve some problems in daily life or in the company&rsquo;s operation. In fact, his actual job is to make life and the operation process easier with my computer program. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has great teamwork skills, when a program is written, it has to be tested by other programmers to assure the result. Therefore, communication is one of the crucial criteria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am really impressed by his passion for work. He can talk about his work for hours to us. I can see the delight in his eyes whenever he shares about his Software and Coding. And he always puts his heart and soul into every task no matter how hard it is. I think that he is really good at his work, primarily because he actually enjoys the intellectual exchange between himself and his students. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll try my best to become such a great person like him.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
